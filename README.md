AI Project

About project.
I made this project to take my first step into artifical intelligence. This project has 3 phases in terms of getting data, training model, playing the game. This game was Lumberjack from Telegram. In the codes I'm explaining everything with command lines. When you look into the codes you will see "mon". This is a variable that I stated for recording little part of my computer screen. This part will change at the other monitors maybe. You just have to change these values to suit the algorithm for yourself. You can find the best values for yourself with shotting the screen of the game and looking the coordinates from paint :P Good luck!
